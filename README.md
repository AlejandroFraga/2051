# [2051](https://leavemeal0ne.itch.io/2051)

Game made for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org) of 2021. The theme was lost & found: our take on the theme is the lost of the routines we used to have before the pandemic, which forced us to find new habits and routines. It can be played [here](https://leavemeal0ne.itch.io/2051).

## Description

It is the year 2051, the year in which you had proposed to open the time capsule that you prepared 30 years ago, which contains the experiences you had in 2020, during the global pandemic caused by COVID-19.

2051 is a game designed for mobile devices that is composed of several mini-games.

Each minigame will have specific mechanics, but they all share the same common actions or controls: taps, drag or drag & drop.

All these mini-games are about activities carried out by many of us during the 2020 lockdown: making video calls with friends or family,  making bread, or doing yoga.
